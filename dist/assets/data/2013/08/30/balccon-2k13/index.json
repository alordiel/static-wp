Be part of something special as our goal is to establish BalCCon as a traditional annual event which will feature a broad variety of topics covering both technical and social aspects of our digital society. Our program consists of numerous presentations, workshops and lectures about privacy, technology, programming, the world of hackerspaces, free software and even taking into consideration socio-political issues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On BalCCon 2k13 we want to put also focus on groups meeting and discussing topics. For many groups it was hard to find a decent home base to discuss ideas and get new folks interested in their community. For interested hackers it became harder to find someone to talk to, as everyone was wandering around.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have a solution for that: &#8222;Hackerspace&#8220; on BalCCon. We want to capture the camp&#8217;s spirit in semi-open assemblies called &#8222;Hackerspace&#8220; üòâ</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, if you are a group of hackers who like to work and hang out together, bring your toys, work on projects, have fun and let others participate in what you‚Äôre doing!</p>\n","featuredMedia":null,"categories":[{"id":"10","title":"–ù–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∏","path":"/category/news/"}],"tags":[]}},"context":{}}
